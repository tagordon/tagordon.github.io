	</header>
	<p>I'm a graduate student in the Astronomy Department at the University of Washington working towards a Dual-Title PhD in Astronomy and Astrobiology. My research interests are detection and characterization of exoplanets. I'm currently working with Professor Eric Agol to investigate prospects for detecting exomoons using the James Webb Space Telescope.
