	<p>
		I'm a graduate student in the Astronomy Department at the University of Washington working towards a Dual-Title PhD in Astronomy and Astrobiology. My research interests are detection and characterization of exoplanets. I'm currently working with Professor Eric Agol to investigate prospects for detecting exomoons using the James Webb Space Telescope.

		<p>
			Currently, I'm working to understand the capabilities of the soon-to-launch James Webb Space Telescope as they pertain to observing exoplanetary transits.
			The goal is to design observations that can detect the transit of an exomoon - the moon of an exoplanet. To achieve this goal we must also
			be able to identify which planetary systems are most likely to host exomoons. For this reason, I'm also interested in the dynamical stability
			of exomoons, as well as their formation.

			In the past, I've worked on writing code to model synchrotron and inverse compton emissions from blazars, and
			simulating soft matter systems using a variety of numerical methods including Dissipative Particle
			Dynamics (DPD), Molecular Dynamics, and Monte Carlo methods.
