# Hello World
This is my first blog post on my new Jekyll site. It’s just a test post really. I’m wondering if I can simplify things even further by writing it up in a markdown editor (bear in this case) that will export html. Let’s see how it goes!

Here are some various elements that I want to test out. 

### A list:
* First item 
	* Got some 
	* Subitems!

> A new nation…  
> Ask not what you can do for your country…”  

Abe and JFK

``` python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as pl

x = np.linspace(1, 100, 100)
y = x**2.

pl.plot(x, y, '.')
```
