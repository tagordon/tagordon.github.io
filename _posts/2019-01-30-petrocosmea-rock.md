The genus name Petrocosmea comes from the Greek for "rock" and "pretty". As the name suggests, many Petrocosmea are lythophytes. I thought I'd try my hand at growing a few plants this way. The plant with crinkly leaves is Petrocosmea begonifolia, the one with yellowish leaves on the outside is Petrocosmea 'Keystone's Harvest Moon', and the smallest one is Petrocosmea sp.
