	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<div class="content">
	<div>
	<p>
		I'm a PhD student in Astronomy and Astrobiology at
		the University of Washington. I have bachelor's degrees
		in both physics and applied mathematics, with a minor in
		computer science from Boise State University. I've been
		tutoring since 2013. If you need help in Astronomy, Physics,
		or Mathematics, please contact me to set up a tutoring session!
	</p>
	<p>
		Below you'll find lists of the courses that I tutor from Seattle
		Central Community College and The University of Washington. I'm
		also able to tutor similar courses offered at other institutions,
		as well as high school math and physics.
	</p>
	</div>
	<div class="image"><img src="docs/face.jpg" alt="this is me" width="300" height="320"></div>
	</div>
	<p>
		I'm happy to set up a recurring session, or to tutor you on an as-needed basis.
	</p>

	</p>
	<h3>Tutoring Philosophy</h3>
	<p>
		We all know that math and science concepts build on each other, and that if one doesn't build a
		strong foundation as they move through a course or sequence of courses, it can become increasingly
		difficult to keep up with the curriculum. This is why I believe that one of my most important jobs as
		a tutor is to make sure that students are able to keep up and build those foundations as their course
		progresses. The way in which I accomplish that goal depends to some extent on the learning style and
		preferences of an individual student, but usually involves supervised problem solving. By working through
		problems with my supervision, I can aid the student in identifying misunderstandings or common mistakes
		before they become habit, and before they begin to interfere with the student's progress.
	</p>
	<p>
		While I prefer to tutor students on a regular basis, because regular tutoring gives
		the highest probability of success, I can also tutor on an as-needed basis to help
		students prepare for tests or to review old material. As a long time student myself, I
		also have a wealth of experience in test preparation to draw on, and can provide a
		variety of study techniques and tips that I've found useful.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have any questions about my philosophy or technique, feel free to send me an email. I also strive
		to be responsive to the needs of individual students, as every student learns and develops skills in a
		unique way.
